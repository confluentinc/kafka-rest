 * ProduceRecord implementation, a Producer in the ProducerPool (with corresponding Kafka
 * serializer), ConsumerRecord implementation, and a serializer for any instantiated consumers.

 * Note that for each type, it's assumed that the key and value can be handled by the same

 * Indexed/Generic/SpecificRecord for Avro) and boxed primitive types (Integer, Boolean, etc.).
