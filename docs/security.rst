Rest Proxy Security Overview
----------------------------

REST Proxy supports security features, including:

* :ref:`SSL` for securing communication between REST clients and the REST Proxy (HTTPS)
* :ref:`SSL encryption <encryption-ssl-rest-proxy>` between the REST Proxy and a secure Kafka cluster
* :ref:`SSL authentication<authentication-ssl-rest-proxy>` between the REST Proxy and a secure Kafka Cluster
* :ref:`SASL authentication<kafka_sasl_auth>` between the REST Proxy and a secure Kafka Cluster 

For more configuration details, check the :ref:`configuration options<kafkarest_config>`.

By default, all the requests to the broker use the same Kerberos Principal or the SSL certificate
to communicate with the broker when the ``client.security.protocol`` is configured to be either
of SSL, SASL_PLAIN, or SASL_SSL. With this behavior, it's not possible to set fine-grained ACL's for
individual topics. This behavior can be modified by using the Confluent Security Plugins. Refer to
:ref:`Kafka Rest Security Plugins<confluentsecurityplugins_kafaka_rest_security_plugin>` for more
details.
