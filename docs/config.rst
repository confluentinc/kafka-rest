Configuration Options
=====================

In addition to the settings specified here, the Kafka REST Proxy accepts the settings for the
Java producer and consumer (currently the new producer and old consumer). Use these to override
the default settings of producers and consumers in the REST Proxy. When configuration options are
exposed in the REST API, priority is given to settings in the user request, then to overrides
provided as configuration options, and finally falls back to the default values provided by the
Java Kafka clients.


``id``
  Unique ID for this REST server instance. This is used in generating unique IDs for consumers that do not specify their ID. The ID is empty by default, which makes a single server setup easier to get up and running, but is not safe for multi-server deployments where automatic consumer IDs are used.

  * Type: string
  * Default: ""
  * Importance: high

``listeners``
  Comma-separated list of listeners that listen for API requests over either HTTP or HTTPS. If a listener uses HTTPS, the appropriate SSL configuration parameters need to be set as well.

  * Type: list
  * Default: "http://0.0.0.0:8082"
  * Importance: high

``schema.registry.url``
  The base URL for the schema registry that should be used by the Avro serializer.

  * Type: string
  * Default: "http://localhost:8081"
  * Importance: high

``zookeeper.connect``
  Specifies the ZooKeeper connection string in the form hostname:port where host and port are the host and port of a ZooKeeper server. To allow connecting through other ZooKeeper nodes when that ZooKeeper machine is down you can also specify multiple hosts in the form hostname1:port1,hostname2:port2,hostname3:port3.

  The server may also have a ZooKeeper chroot path as part of it's ZooKeeper connection string which puts its data under some path in the global ZooKeeper namespace. If so the consumer should use the same chroot path in its connection string. For example to give a chroot path of /chroot/path you would give the connection string as hostname1:port1,hostname2:port2,hostname3:port3/chroot/path.

  * Type: string
  * Default: "localhost:2181"
  * Importance: high

``ssl.keystore.location``

  * Type: string
  * Default: ""
  * Importance: high

``ssl.keystore.password``
  Used for HTTPS. The store password for the keystore file.

``consumer.request.max.bytes``
  Maximum number of bytes in unencoded message keys and values returned by a single request. This can be used by administrators to limit the memory used by a single consumer and to control the memory usage required to decode responses on clients that cannot perform a streaming decode. Note that the actual payload will be larger due to overhead from base64 encoding the response data and from JSON encoding the entire response.

  * Type: long

  The maximum total time to wait for messages for a request if the maximum number of messages has not yet been reached.

  * Type: string
  * Default: ""

``consumer.iterator.backoff.ms``
  Amount of time to backoff when an iterator runs out of data. If a consumer has a dedicated worker thread, this is effectively the maximum error for the entire request timeout. It should be small enough to closely target the timeout, but large enough to avoid busy waiting.

  * Type: int
  * Default: 50
  * Importance: low

``consumer.iterator.timeout.ms``
  Timeout for blocking consumer iterator operations. This should be set to a small enough value that it is possible to effectively peek() on the iterator.
