Configuration Options
=====================

In addition to the settings specified here, the Kafka REST Proxy accepts the settings for the
Java producer and consumer (currently the new producer and old consumer). Use these to override
the default settings of producers and consumers in the REST Proxy. When configuration options are
exposed in the REST API, priority is given to settings in the user request, then to overrides
provided as configuration options, and finally falls back to the default values provided by the
Java Kafka clients.


``bootstrap.servers``
  A list of host/port pairs to use for establishing the initial connection to the Kafka cluster. The client will make use of all servers irrespective of which servers are specified here for bootstrappingâ€”this list only impacts the initial hosts used to discover the full set of servers. This list should be in the form host1:port1,host2:port2,.... Since these servers are just used for the initial connection to discover the full cluster membership (which may change dynamically), this list need not contain the full set of servers (you may want more than one, though, in case a server is down).

  * Type: string
  * Default: "PLAINTEXT://localhost:9092"
  * Importance: high

``id``
  Unique ID for this REST server instance. This is used in generating unique IDs for consumers that do not specify their ID. The ID is empty by default, which makes a single server setup easier to get up and running, but is not safe for multi-server deployments where automatic consumer IDs are used.

  * Type: string
  * Default: ""
  * Importance: high

``listeners``
  List of listeners. http and https are supported. Each listener must include the protocol, hostname, and port. For example: http://myhost:8080,https://0.0.0.0:8081

  * Type: list
  * Default: []
  * Importance: high

``schema.registry.url``
  The base URL for the schema registry that should be used by the Avro serializer.

  * Type: string
  * Default: "http://localhost:8081"
  * Importance: high

``ssl.key.password``
  The password of the private key in the keystore file.

  * Type: string
  * Default: ""
  * Importance: high

``ssl.keystore.location``
  Location of the keystore file to use for SSL. This is required for HTTPS.

  * Type: string
  * Default: ""
  * Importance: high

``ssl.keystore.password``
  The store password for the keystore file.

  * Type: string
  * Default: ""
  * Importance: high

``ssl.truststore.location``
  Location of the trust store. Required only to authenticate HTTPS clients.

  * Type: string
  * Default: ""
  * Importance: high

``ssl.truststore.password``
  The store password for the trust store file.

  * Type: string
  * Default: ""
  * Importance: high

``zookeeper.connect``
  Specifies the ZooKeeper connection string in the form hostname:port where host and port are the host and port of a ZooKeeper server. To allow connecting through other ZooKeeper nodes when that ZooKeeper machine is down you can also specify multiple hosts in the form hostname1:port1,hostname2:port2,hostname3:port3.

  The server may also have a ZooKeeper chroot path as part of it's ZooKeeper connection string which puts its data under some path in the global ZooKeeper namespace. If so the consumer should use the same chroot path in its connection string. For example to give a chroot path of /chroot/path you would give the connection string as hostname1:port1,hostname2:port2,hostname3:port3/chroot/path.

  * Type: string
  * Default: "localhost:2181"
  * Importance: high

``consumer.request.max.bytes``
  Maximum number of bytes in unencoded message keys and values returned by a single request. This can be used by administrators to limit the memory used by a single consumer and to control the memory usage required to decode responses on clients that cannot perform a streaming decode. Note that the actual payload will be larger due to overhead from base64 encoding the response data and from JSON encoding the entire response.

  * Type: long

  * Importance: medium

``consumer.request.timeout.ms``
  The maximum total time to wait for messages for a request if the maximum number of messages has not yet been reached.

  * Type: int
  * Default: 1000
  * Importance: medium

``simpleconsumer.max.caches.num``
  Maximum number topic-partition combinations for which records are cached. If 0, then caching is disabled and extra records are thrown away. Cache improves performance if end user fetches records with sequentially increasing offsets.

  * Type: int
  * Default: 0

  * Type: int
  * Default: 300000
  * Importance: low

``consumer.iterator.backoff.ms``
  Amount of time to backoff when an iterator runs out of data. If a consumer has a dedicated worker thread, this is effectively the maximum error for the entire request timeout. It should be small enough to closely target the timeout, but large enough to avoid busy waiting.

  * Type: long
  * Default: 30000

``shutdown.graceful.ms``

  * Type: int
  * Default: 1000
  * Importance: low

``simpleconsumer.max.poll.records``
  Maximum number of records that can be fetched by a single consumer poll request. Since desired number of fetched records can't be defined for every poll request the consumer can poll more records thannecessary (extra records are stored in cache.). The value of this property defines maximum number of excess records fetched by a single user request. The grater value means grater network overhead. It may be reasonable if user retrieves records from specified partition increasing offset sequentially. The smaller value suits better when the user consumes records in a random fashion.Use 0 for no max value allowed by kafka consumer 2147483647
