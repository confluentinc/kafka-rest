|crest| Configuration Options
=============================

In addition to the settings specified here, the |crest-long| accepts the settings for the
Java producer and consumer (currently the new producer and old/new consumers). Use these to override
the default settings of producers and consumers in the |crest|. When configuration options are
exposed in the |crest-long| API, priority is given to settings in the user request, then to overrides
provided as configuration options, and finally falls back to the default values provided by the
Java Kafka clients.

General
-------

``id``
  Unique ID for the |crest-long| server instance. This is used in generating unique IDs for consumers that do not specify their ID. The ID is empty by default, which makes a single server setup easier to get up and running, but is not safe for multi-server deployments where automatic consumer IDs are used.

  * Type: string
  * Default: ""
  * Importance: high

``bootstrap.servers``
  A list of Kafka brokers to connect to. For example, ``PLAINTEXT://hostname:9092,SSL://hostname2:9092``. This configuration is particularly important when Kafka security is enabled, because Kafka may expose multiple endpoints that all will be stored in |zk|, but |crest|  may need to be configured with just one of those endpoints. The client will make use of all servers irrespective of which servers are specified here for bootstrappingâ€”this list only impacts the initial hosts used to discover the full set of servers. Since these servers are just used for the initial connection to discover the full cluster membership (which may change dynamically), this list need not contain the full set of servers (you may want more than one, though, in case a server is down).


``listeners``
  Comma-separated list of listeners that listen for API requests over either HTTP or HTTPS. If a listener uses HTTPS, the appropriate SSL configuration parameters need to be set as well.

  * Type: list
  * Default: "http://0.0.0.0:8082"
  * Importance: high

``schema.registry.url``
  The base URL for |sr| that should be used by the Avro serializer.

  * Type: string
  * Default: "http://localhost:8081"
  * Importance: high

``zookeeper.connect``
  Specifies the |zk| connection string in the form hostname:port where host and port are the host and port of a |zk| server. To allow connecting through other |zk| nodes when that |zk| machine is down you can also specify multiple hosts in the form hostname1:port1,hostname2:port2,hostname3:port3.

  The server may also have a |zk| chroot path as part of it's |zk| connection string which puts its data under some path in the global |zk| namespace. If so the consumer should use the same chroot path in its connection string. For example to give a chroot path of /chroot/path you would give the connection string as hostname1:port1,hostname2:port2,hostname3:port3/chroot/path.

  * Type: string
  * Default: "localhost:2181"
  * Importance: high

``consumer.request.max.bytes``
  Maximum number of bytes in unencoded message keys and values returned by a single request. This can be used by administrators to limit the memory used by a single consumer and to control the memory usage required to decode responses on clients that cannot perform a streaming decode. Note that the actual payload will be larger due to overhead from base64 encoding the response data and from JSON encoding the entire response.

  * Type: long
  * Default: 67108864
  * Importance: medium

``consumer.threads``
  The maximum number of threads to run consumer requests on. Note that this must be greater than the maximum number of consumers in a single consumer group.
  The sentinel value of -1 allows the number of threads to grow as needed to fulfill active consumer requests. Inactive threads will ultimately be stopped and cleaned up.
  * Type: int
  * Default: 50
  * Importance: medium

``consumer.request.timeout.ms``
  The maximum total time to wait for messages for a request if the maximum number of messages has not yet been reached.

  * Type: int
  * Default: 1000
  * Importance: medium

``host.name``
  The host name used to generate absolute URLs in responses. If empty, the default canonical hostname is used

  * Type: string
  * Default: ""
  * Importance: medium

``simpleconsumer.pool.size.max``
  Maximum number of SimpleConsumers that can be instantiated per broker. If 0, then the pool size is not limited.

  * Default: 25
  * Importance: medium



``access.control.allow.methods``
  Set value to Jetty Access-Control-Allow-Origin header for specified methods

  * Type: string

  * Importance: low

``access.control.allow.origin``
  Set value for Jetty Access-Control-Allow-Origin header

  * Type: string
  * Default: ""
  * Importance: low

``consumer.instance.timeout.ms``
  Amount of idle time before a consumer instance is automatically destroyed.

  * Type: int
  * Default: 300000
  * Importance: low

``consumer.iterator.backoff.ms``
  Amount of time to backoff when an iterator runs out of data. If a consumer has a dedicated worker thread, this is effectively the maximum error for the entire request timeout. It should be small enough to closely target the timeout, but large enough to avoid busy waiting.

  * Type: int
  * Default: 50
  * Importance: low

``consumer.iterator.timeout.ms``
  Timeout for blocking consumer iterator operations. This should be set to a small enough value that it is possible to effectively peek() on the iterator.

  * Type: int
  * Default: 1
  * Importance: low

``debug``
  Boolean indicating whether extra debugging information is generated in some error response entities.

  * Type: boolean
  * Default: false
  * Importance: low

``metric.reporters``
  A list of classes to use as metrics reporters. Implementing the <code>MetricReporter</code> interface allows plugging in classes that will be notified of new metric creation. The JmxReporter is always included to register JMX statistics.

  * Type: list
  * Default: []
  * Importance: low

``metrics.jmx.prefix``
  Prefix to apply to metric names for the default JMX reporter.

  * Type: string
  * Default: "kafka.rest"
  * Importance: low

``metrics.num.samples``
  The number of samples maintained to compute metrics.

  * Type: int
  * Default: 2
  * Importance: low

``metrics.sample.window.ms``
  The metrics system maintains a configurable number of samples over a fixed window size. This configuration controls the size of the window. For example we might maintain two samples each measured over a 30 second period. When a window expires we erase and overwrite the oldest window.

  * Type: long
  * Default: 30000
  * Importance: low

``port``
  DEPRECATED: port to listen on for new connections. Use `listeners` instead.

  * Type: int

``producer.threads``
  Number of threads to run produce requests on.

  * Type: int
  * Default: 5

Kafka SASL configurations are described :ref:`here <kafka_sasl_auth>`.

Note that all the SASL configurations (for |crest| to Broker communication) are prefixed with "client". If you want the configuration to apply just to consumers or just to producers, you can replace the prefix with "consumer" or "producer" respectively.

In addition to these configurations:

* Make sure ``bootstrap.servers`` configuration is set with SASL_PLAINTEXT://host:port (or SASL_SSL://host:port) end-points, or you'll accidentally open an SASL connection to a non-SASL port.
* Pass the name of the JAAS file and the name of Kerberos config file via environment variables to the |crest|. For example:

  .. sourcecode:: bash

    $ export KAFKAREST_OPTS="-Djava.security.auth.login.config=/mnt/security/jaas.conf -Djava.security.krb5.conf=/mnt/security/krb5.conf"; \
    /opt/kafka-rest/bin/kafka-rest-start /mnt/rest.properties 1>> /mnt/rest.log 2>> /mnt/rest.log &


* If you need to access |sr| via https protocol, one would need additional javax.net.ssl.trustStore and javax.net.ssl.trustStorePassword parameters, as shown below:

  .. sourcecode:: bash

    $ export KAFKAREST_OPTS='-Djava.security.auth.login.config=/mnt/security/jaas.conf -Djava.security.krb5.conf=/mnt/security/krb5.conf -Djavax.net.ssl.trustStore=/mnt/security/test.truststore.jks -Djavax.net.ssl.trustStorePassword=test-ts-passwd'; \
   /opt/kafka-rest/bin/kafka-rest-start /mnt/rest.properties 1>> /mnt/rest.log 2>> /mnt/rest.log &

* For more details about krb5.conf file please see `JDKâ€™s Kerberos Requirements <https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/security/jgss/tutorials/KerberosReq.html>`_.
* Keep in mind that authenticated and encrypted connection to Apache Kafka will only work when Kafka brokers (and |sr|, if used) are running with appropriate security configuration.
